# meteor-leaderboard
Leaderboard built in Meteor
Hosted for free at http://prakal-leaderboard.meteor.com/ - Let me know what you think of it!

- I followed the tutorial on http://meteortips.com to initialize a reactive leaderboard on Meteor.
- I added CSS styling (bootstrap), score injection, and some beautification (minimalism)

To do:
- Keypress events (Enable a keyUp and keyDown to toggle through values in the table, and Del to remove person from leaderboard)
- Drag and drop
